HTTP
HyperText Transfer Protocol
General means of communication across the worldwide web.
Browsers send HTTP requests to servers, and servers send HTTP responses back.
Packets are broken up into Head and Body
HTTP requests have methods that define the type of request.

Get (Read)
    Generally used for retrieving data
    We include parameters in the URL to send information
    Request body is (cannot be) used
    Header contains a lot of information about encoding, packetâ€™s destination (IP address), other metadata.
Post (Create)
    Generally used for sending information in the request body.
    Better for logins, sensitive information, etc. since Get requests would include the sensitive information as parameters in the URL.
    Not limited in size.
Status codes (response)

    200-299: all is well
    300-399: redirect
    400-499: bad request (404 not found is the most familiar one)
